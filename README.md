# OneLiner
One liner is a program I am writing to make more efficient the process of writing custom M extensions to run in Epic EMR software. At my org we currently dont have the released tools that are typically used so we manually need to consolidate the lines of our extensions (small programs) to one line.

One liner is my solution to this problem.
